# FModSilo

FModSilo is a language server for Factorio modding. It will be updated when it will be updated, as I also have plenty of other things to take care of. I will try to maintain the project as well as I can and keep working on it in my free time, though. This is only the server part of FModSilo. I'm also working on a VSCode extension connecting the editor to the server: https://github.com/DragonGamesStudios/fmodsilo-vscode. Note, that to get the extension working, you need both this extension and the server. You will also have to build the server yourself, e. g. using `cargo install fmodsilo_interface_stdio`.

## Features
It's pretty much a newborn project, so the server doesn't do much. Yet. There is, however, quite a lot of planned features.
